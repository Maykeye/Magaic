I still couldn't believe the acceptance letter hadn't been a clerical error; standing here in the grand atrium of the Celestia Academy for Arcane Maidens, I was painfully aware that I was the only student wearing trousers amidst a sea of frilly skirts and high-caliber magical staves.

To my left, a girl with chaotic pink pigtails named Aiko was already causing a disaster, having tripped over her own overly long wand and sent a cascade of volatile glitter potions crashing onto the pristine marble floor, apologizing profusely to the inanimate objects she had offended.

Leaning against the pillars in the back was Yuki, a tall girl with icy blue hair who hadn't blinked in five minutes; she simply stared at the chaos with dead, bored eyes while idly freezing the moisture in the air into tiny, levitating snowflakes.

Then there was Rin, who had been glaring daggers at me since I walked in, crossing her arms to emphasize her uniform while loudly declaring that she certainly wasn't impressed by a 'glitch in the system' like me, despite her face turning the bright red color of a fire spell.

I took a deep breath, adjusted my tie to stop my hands from shaking, and gave them a nervous wave: "Uh, hey everyone, I'm Kenji, and I guess I'll be in your care starting today."
